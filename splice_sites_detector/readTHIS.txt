NOTE: This code is for deep learning model, which need a gpu configuration.

==== training directory ====
contains:
    1- 'CNN_spliceSites_training.ipynb', which is the training process source code.
    2- 'binary_icgr.txt', 'label2.txt' which are the input to the CNN.
    3- 'CNN14.h5', which is the output, the trained model.
    4- 'model_evaluation.ipynb', which contains some performance rate.
    5- 'preparing_seq', directory which contains dna files preparing to be an input to CNN.

NOTE: We build our neural based on 'spliceFinder' tool and used the same data to compare 
our results with their. They used one_hot_encoding representing DNA sequence, so we reversed this 
encoding to get back the original data and then processed it in our way.

==== prediction directory ====
contains: 
    1- '_binary_icgr_generate__.py', which handles the fastq file to classy its reads.
    2- 'CNN14.h5', which is the trained model, we'll load its weights and use them in the classification.
    3- 'dummy' directory, which contains random fastq data to try the CNN.
